        <h2>Albania History</h2>
        <p>The history of Albania forms a part of the history of Europe.
             During the classical times, Albania was home to several Illyrian tribes such as the Ardiaei, 
             Albanoi, Amantini, Enchele, Taulantii and many others, but also Thracian and Greek tribes, as well as several Greek colonies established on the Illyrian coast.
              In the 3rd century BC, the area was annexed by Rome and became part of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia, Macedonia and Moesia Superior. 
              Afterwards, the territory remained under Roman and Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century.
               It was integrated into the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century.</p>
               <p>In the Middle Ages, the Principality of ArbÃ«r and a Sicilian union known as the medieval Kingdom of Albania were established.
                    Some areas became part of the Venetian and later Serbian Empire.
                     During the mid 14th century most of the southern Balkans was dominated by the Albanian principalities until the end of the 15th century when it fell to the rapid invasion of the Ottoman Empire.
                      It remained under Ottoman control as part of the province of Rumelia until 1912; with some interruptions during the 18th and 19th century with the establishment of the autonomy Albanian minded lords.
                       The first independent Albanian state was founded by the Albanian Declaration of Independence following a short occupation by the Kingdom of Serbia.[1] The formation of an Albanian national consciousness dates to the later 19th century and is part of the larger phenomenon of the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire.</p>
